# Gestalt

A helper library for data science pipelines

"_Something that is made of many parts and yet is somehow more than or different from the combination of its parts_"

Machine learning (ML) has achieved considerable success in multiple fields, much of the pipeline surrounding machine 
learning can be generalised to a point that removes the 'engineering' of the data flows and pipelines leaving the human
expert to work on the most difficult aspects:

1. Pre-processing the data
2. Feature Engineering
3. Select appropriate features

## The goals of Gestalt
The goal of Gestalt is to remove the cumbersome parts of building a data science pipeline.

1. Load Data
2. Select Algorithm
3. Tune Algorithm 
4. Dump models
5. Predict against a test set.
